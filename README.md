# TryMudBlazor

## What is Blazor REPL?
TryMudBlazor is a playground for trying out and testing [MudBlazor](https://mudblazor.com) components entirely in the browser. It is based on [Blazor REPL](https://blazorrepl.com) which is running entirely on top of Blazor WASM - the [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org) hosting model of [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor).
